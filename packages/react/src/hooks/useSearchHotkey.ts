 * Should Cmd/Ctrl+F open the canvas search overlay for this keystroke?
 *
 * The listener is on `window` so the overlay works in read-only mode (where
 * the canvas root is not tab-focusable), which means it also sees keystrokes
 * belonging to the host app. Consumers embed the canvas next to their own UI
 * — a chat panel, a sidebar — and hijacking Cmd+F there both opens the wrong
 * search and suppresses the browser's native find.
 *
 * Focus alone isn't enough to tell the two apart: most of a host app's chrome
 * isn't focusable, so clicking it leaves the keystroke on `<body>`, exactly as
 * if the user had never clicked anything. Hence `canvasActive`, which the hook
 * derives from where the last pointerdown landed.
 *
 * @param canvasActive whether the canvas was the last region the user clicked
